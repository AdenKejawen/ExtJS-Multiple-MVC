ExtJS-Multiple-MVC.

The included code is ment to be cloned into the examples folder of ExtJS. 

!! Dont create a subfolder. Just be in the examples folder and clone from there !!

The files that you need to copy to make your own application multi mvc is:

Portal/MVCHelper.js
Portal/app/controller/MVCLoader.js

Load MVCHelper.js before your app.js in your index.html

Use MVCLoader as a controller in your main app. You want to change the class name to fit your app name. It will be as any other controller in your app.

Tell loader where your sub applications are. Look in Portal/app.js for guidance.
