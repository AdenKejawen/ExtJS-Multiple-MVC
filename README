ExtJS-Multiple-MVC.

Just clone or fetch. You need ExtJS-4.1.3 to run the built version. Use dev.html for all other versions.

Use index.html for the built version.

Use dev.html for using Ext.Loader.

The files that you need to copy to make your own application multi mvc is:

Portal/MVCHelper.js
Portal/app/controller/MVCLoader.js

Load MVCHelper.js before your app.js in your index.html

Use MVCLoader as a controller in your main app. You want to change the class name to fit your app name. It will be as any other controller in your app.

Tell loader where your sub applications are. Look in Portal/app.js for guidance.
